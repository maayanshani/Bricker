## Answers to Questions

1. We passed the `BrickerGameManager` instance to the constructor of `BasicCollisionStrategy` and used its
public methods to manage bricks and other objects.
Advantages: Centralized object management ensures consistency and simplifies handling of additional behaviors
or object types in future extensions.
Disadvantages: This approach increases coupling between `BasicCollisionStrategy` and `BrickerGameManager`.

2. We created two different classes, one for the numeric counter and another for the hearts.
In the `Heart` class, we implemented the `shouldCollideWith` function,
and the display of the number of lives is managed in `Layer.UI`,
which does not interact with the ball, packs, or bricks.

3. Each behavior is implemented in a separate strategy class that implements `CollisionStrategy`.
For the extra pack, we created a new `Pack` class that extends `Ball` and used it.
For the extra paddle, we added an additional parameter, `isExtraPaddle`, to the constructor,
allowing us to distinguish between the original paddle and the extra one.
For returning lives, we used the `Heart` class and implemented a new strategy called `HeartCollideStrategy`.
For the turbo feature, we created a function in the `GameManager` that changes the ball's velocity,
used the collision counter to track its progress, and reset the speed to normal in the update function
once it was done.

4. The system randomly selects 2-3 strategies, ensuring no more than 3 are active at a time.
It accepts `CollisionStrategy[]` as arguments, and upon collision,
it uses all strategies' `onCollide` methods.

5. New classes such as `Heart`, `Pack`,  were added to gameObjects package to enable a modular design.
HeartCollideStrategy were added to a new package heartStrategy to allow the returnLiveStrategy and the
collision between heart and the paddle.
we changed updateLives method in brickerGameMangaer to public for allowing adding life to the player
when the heart and paddle collide.

Support additional features like lives and special brick behaviors. Public methods were added to the
`GameManager` to support these changes.

## Building
- Start by adding DanoGameLab.jar and src to the modules inside Project Structure. 
- Go to File > Project Structure > Modules.
- Click + > JARs or Directories.
- inside DanoGameLab select BOTH src and DanoGameLab.jar.
- Click OK and then another OK to save.
